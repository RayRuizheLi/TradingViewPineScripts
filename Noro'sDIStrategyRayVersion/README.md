## Trading Advice 

The backtesting script buys and trending changes from 1 to -1. Through testing, it is found that almost always 1 is a 
good entry point but -1 is a less good exist point. 

It is found that exiting when RSI reaches around 70-80 is a better exit point at times than when trend changes to from 1 to -1. 



Profitable? Yes
